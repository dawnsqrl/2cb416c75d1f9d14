  <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p>This is a Unity remaster of the classic 1986 game <i>The Legend of Zelda</i>, with a customized extra level "The End Dungeon" that features new maps, weapons, and mechanisms.</p> <a href="https://yanmeeei.github.io/Zelda1986-UnityRemaster">Link to web build</a>
  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p><a href="https://yanmeeei.github.io/portfolio">Yanmei Wang</a> and I developed the remaster. We worked together on audio implementation and customized level design. I am responsible for implementing various weapons, grid-based movement, player health / damage management, cheat mode, a special 2D room, game UIs, customized level mechanisms, and relevant testing / bug fixes.</p>
  <h3>Technology Used</h3>
  <p>This is a Unity remaster of the classic 1986 game "The Legend of Zelda," with an extra customized level that features new maps, weapons and mechanisms. The remaster was developed using the programming language C#, a robust and widely-used programming language in the gaming industry, and Unity, a popular game engine that provides a suite of tools and features for cross-platform game development. The remaster utilizes the capabilities of Unity to bring a modern touch to the classic game while maintaining the original charm and gameplay.<br>
  The WebGL build of the game is hosted on GitHub Page, a web hosting service that allows developers to host static web pages directly from a GitHub repository.

  <h3>About the Project</h3>
  <p>This is a 3D first-person puzzle concept made with Unity. The player can view the environment in only red / green / blue channel or in grayscale. The color of observation changes which objects the player can interact with.</p> <p>Download <a href="">Windows build</a> or <a href="">Mac build</a></p>
  <h3>Contributions</h3>
  <p>This prototype was independently developed by me. I was responsible for the first-person control system implementation, core mechanics design, shader programming, terrain modelling and sound effect synthesis.</p>
  <h3>Technology Used</h3>
  <p>This project had made heavy use of the Unity URP shader system. The terrain and barrier textures were all dynamically generated with shader graphs. The camera color filter was made possible by the "Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature," a new renderer feature introduced in URP version 14 for Unity 2022+.<br>
  All images and downloadable archives are hosted on the GitHub repository.
